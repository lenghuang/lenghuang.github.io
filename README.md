# Personal Website

This is my personal website! I've been messing around with various designs, frameworks, and more. You can see different versions on the branches! Some include `react`, `gatsby`, `gatsby-nav`, and `vue`. I wanted this website not only to be a display of my projects and experiences, but also a way to tell my **story**.

The website is based around the premise of having a personal **who**, **what**, **when**, **where**, and **why**.

### Who

I was born and raised in Holmdel, New Jersey. Having graduated from high school in 2019, I began moving past my days of athletics / advocacy and started looking to find my place in the world.

The next summer, I found myself studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Here, I would make life-long friendships, challenge myself academically like never before, and channel my creativity through projects.

This website is my personal story. I've told you who I am. Now let me tell you what I can do, when I've done these things, where I've done them, and finally why we should connect.

Thanks for reading through my story and learning more about my background. This has been my who, what, when, and where. If any of those interested you, that's a reason why for us to chat!
