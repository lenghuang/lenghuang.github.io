# Personal Website

This is my personal website! I've been messing around with various designs, frameworks, and more. You can see different versions on the branches! Some include `react`, `gatsby`, `gatsby-nav`, and `vue`. I wanted this website not only to be a display of my projects and experiences, but also a way to tell my **story**.

The website is based around the premise of having a personal **who**, **what**, **when**, **where**, and **why**.

Thanks for reading through my story and learning more about my background. This has been my who, what, when, and where. If any of those interested you, that's a reason why for us to chat!
